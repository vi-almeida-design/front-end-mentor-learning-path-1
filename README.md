### What I learned

This challenge is very simple, but I realized that I need to understand the ```align``` and ```justify``` properties better. 

I also got stuck with really basic stuff, like centering the two elements (QR Code Card and the Attribution Text below) in the page. I was unable to properly align them vertically because the ```body``` of my document was as tall as those two elements.

I just needed to use ```max-height:100vh``` and it'd be good to go.

My name is Vin√≠cius, but it might be easier to just call me Vi or Vini. I'm an undergraduate Graphic Designer.

Currently I'm dabbling into HTML/CSS on my free-time because it's genuinely fun and because it's a nice skill to have since I want to be able to work on Web-Design (although I'm more than aware that it's not a requirement in the slightest).
